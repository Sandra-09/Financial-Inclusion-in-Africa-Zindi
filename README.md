# Financial Inclusion in Africa

Problem statement and Objective summary

Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.
The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. 
The models and solutions developed can provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individualsâ€™ financial outcomes.
